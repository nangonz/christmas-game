## Vanilla Javascript project

FreeCodeCamp project using vanilla javascript, HTML and CSS.  

This is a project base on the freeCodeCamp and Ademir Alijagic's  
javascript project using HMTL, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. This  
project is about crafting the popular snake game with a christmas  
theme populating the board with randomly generated gift items and  
controling Santa Claus' movement across the board with the  
ability to enhance the wrapped gifts' size as it consumes items,  
adding a layer of complexity and excitement to the game. The game  
will also incrementally increase the speed.  

Beyond the gameplay mechanics, the project also covers essential  
aspects like scorekeeping, track the score, monitor collisions,  
and display and record high scores. If you want to try the game,
